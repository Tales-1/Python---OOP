# Shoe Stock Tracker || HyperionDev Software Engineering Bootcamp

The Shoe Stock Tracker is a Python application written using object-oriented programming. The app allows a user to read, track, and update shoe stock saved in a .txt file

The user can interact with the .txt file in many ways such as:
  - retrieving the value for each shoe
  - searching a shoe by its unique code
  - viewing all shoes in stock
  - add a new shoe to the stock
  - finding the shoe with the least qty and updating its value
  - finding shoe with the highest qty and letting the user know it is for sale



This project is important for individuals or businesses that deal with shoe sales or shoe stock management. With the Shoe Stock Tracker, users can easily manage their shoe stock, track the quantity of each shoe, and quickly retrieve information about each shoe's value and unique code.
