# Python---OOP Capstone project

Using the fundamentals of OOP in Python, I created a program which allows the user to read and track shoe stock in a .txt file.

The user can interact with the .txt file in many ways such as:

  - retrieving the value for each shoe
  - searching a shoe by its unique code
  - viewing all shoes in stock
  - add a new shoe to the stock
  - finding the shoe with the least qty and updating its value
  - finding shoe with the highest qty and letting the user know it is for sale
